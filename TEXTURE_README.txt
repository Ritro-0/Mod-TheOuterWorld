QUANTUM PAD TEXTURE NEEDED
==========================

The Quantum Pad block has been created, but it needs a texture file.

Location needed:
src/main/resources/assets/theouterworld/textures/block/quantum_pad.png

Texture requirements:
- File format: PNG
- Recommended size: 16x16 pixels (or 32x32, 64x64 for higher resolution)
- The UV mapping in the model expects a standard texture layout

You can:
1. Create the texture in an image editor (Paint.NET, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Use Blockbench's texture painting feature
3. Export from your existing Blockbench project if you have one

Suggested colors for a "Quantum Pad":
- Purple/Magenta tones (quantum/magical)
- Blue/Cyan (technology/sci-fi)
- Or any creative design you prefer!

Once you add the texture file, the block will render properly in-game.
